\description{
The goal of \code{EpiCompare} is to provide the epidemiology community with
easy-to-use tools to encourage comparing and assessing epidemics and
epidemiology models in a time-free manner. All tools attempt to adhere to
\code{\link[tidyverse]{tidyverse}}/\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot2}} style to
enhance easy of use.
}
\details{
Time free analysis allows for stronger comparison of epidemics and model
based simulations avoiding different scaling and shifts of time that mess up
time-based comparisons.

To achieve this goal, the package contains:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Visualization tools} to visualize SIR epidemics and simulations
from SIR models in a time-free manner using \code{\link[ggtern]{ggtern}}â€™s
ternary plots and prediction bands. For agent-based SIR models we also
provide visualization tools to let the user easily explore how different
characteristics of the agents relate to different experiences in the
epidemic.

\item \strong{General comparison} tools to compare epidemics and epidemic
models that have higher numbers of states (again in a time-free manner),
allowing for the user to examine the differences between models through
simulations, and if an epidemic is similar to a model through simulations and
prediction bands.

\item \strong{Conversion tools} to:
\itemize{
\item Convert and then compare models from \emph{standard epidemic packages}
like \code{\link[EpiModel]{EpiModel}}, \code{\link[pomp]{pomp}}, as well as
internal agent-based models, and epidemics in a common framework.
\item Convert \emph{agent-based information into aggregate} to compare in the
aggregate framework described above.
