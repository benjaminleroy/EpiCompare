\title{EpiCompare: Ternary plot visualization for SIR curves (UPDATE)}
\description{
The goal of EpiCompare is to develop functional based visualization and
statistics that focus on use in ternary plots. (UPDATE)
}
\details{
This package attempts to:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Comparisons Model and Epidemic Comparisons}: We provide easy
  ways to compare multiple epidemics, epidemics vs models, or models verse
  models with ternary plots and confidence analysis
    \itemize{
      \item Ternary plots have been shown to help show time-independent like
      comparing R_0
      \item Added confidence band structure allows for examining variability
      within simulations from models cleanly (and without worrying about time
      variation)
        \itemize{
          \item Provides ways to moves beyond pointwise examination to
          uniform containment
        }
    }
  \item \strong{Agent (->/ vs) Aggregate}: Provide easy way to compare agents
  based data/modeling vs aggregation
    \itemize{
      \item Our tools provide easy ways to explore different grouping of
      agents and understanding how these groups different through aggregation
      visualizations (see Shannonâ€™s thesis for rational of quick access to
      grouping abilities)
   }
  \item\strong{ggplot2/ggtern and tidyverse}: tools exist in the rapidly
  expanding tidyverse/ggplot2 paradigm, allowing for quick deployment and
  less cost in learning new assessment tools
 }
