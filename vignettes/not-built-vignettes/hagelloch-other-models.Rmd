## Overview

In this series of vignettes, we will demonstrate epidemic analysis pipeline from EDA to dissemination using a case study of measles.

## Goals in this vignette

1. Recap our work with the Hagelloch vignette thus far

2. Explain `EpiCompare`'s role in incorporating other models such as from `EpiModel`.

4. Include side-by-side comparison of different models 

## The story so far

In this series of vignettes, we have looked at the Hagelloch measles outbreak and suspect that the classes have different rates of infection.  In particular, we suspect a 'super-spreader' event in the first class to be driving the fit of our models.  This event makes it so that within that class the infection rate is very large and relatively small in the other compartments.  Our model fits do not accurately capture the two peaks of infection seen in our data.

We now use the `EpiModel` package to simulate a network-based outbreak on the Hagelloch children.

## `EpiCompare` works with your modeling packages

We at `EpiCompare` understand the importance and necessity of model variety and also the value of reproducibility in code.  We aim to facilitate this important process by allowing users to more easily interact and assess different modeling paradigms.

We look at a couple here..

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
library(forcats)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}

library(EpiModel)
library(EpiCompare)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}

```


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
saveRDS(sim_output, "sim_output_hagelloch_epimodel1.RDS")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
sim_output <- readRDS("sim_output_hagelloch_epimodel1.RDS")
```


```{r message = FALSE}
fortified_net <- fortify_aggregate(sim_output, states = c("s.num", "i.num", "r.num"))

```


```{r, warning = FALSE, message =  FALSE}
obs_groups <- hagelloch_raw %>%
    mutate(class = ifelse(CL == "1st class",
                        1,
                        ifelse(CL == "2nd class",
                               2, 0))) %>%
  agents_to_aggregate(states = c(tI, tR),
                      min_max_time = c(0, 55)) %>%
   rename(time = t, S = X0, I = X1, R = X2)

  ggplot() +
    geom_prediction_band(data = fortified_net, 
                         aes(x = X0, y = X1, z = X2, t = t, sim_group = as.numeric(sim)),
                         alpha = .2, fill = "blue", color = "blue",
                         conf_level = .9, pb_type = "delta_ball") +
    theme_bw() +
    coord_tern() +
    geom_path(data = fortified_net, aes(x = X0, y = X1, z = X2, group = factor(sim)),
              col = "cornflowerblue", alpha = .5, size = .3) + 
    geom_point(data = obs_groups,
               aes(x = S, y = I, z = R ),
               col = "black") 
  


```


Here we see that the above simulation covers the data quite well.  However, upon closer inspection we see that the single paths (i.e. filaments) of an epidemic are generally not the shape of the observed data which has two distinct peaks.  




```{r eval=FALSE}

plot(sim_output, type = "network", col.status = TRUE, at = 15, sims = 5)

```
