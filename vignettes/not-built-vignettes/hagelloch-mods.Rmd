## Intro the SIR model

The **SIR** model is a classic epidemiological model to describe how individuals move from **S**usceptible to **I**nfectious to **R**ecovered states over a period of time.

There are many ways to implement an SIR model, including describing transitions from one state to another in continuous or discrete time or deterministic or stochastic models.  We will look at a couple instantiations here.

### @kermack1927 SIR model -- a deterministic, continuous time model

The first SIR model was proposed by @kermack1927 and is based on a series of ordinary differential equations (ODE).  The idea is that individuals `flow' from one discrete state (or compartment) to the next.  These compartment-to-compartment transitions are defined by ODEs:

$$
S^\prime(t) = - \beta S(t)I(t)\\
I^\prime(t) = \beta S(t)I(t)  - \gamma I(t)\\
R^\prime(t) = \gamma I(t)
$$
along with the constraint that $S^\prime(t) + I^\prime(t) + R^\prime(t) \equiv 0$ and the initial conditions $(S(0), I(0), R(0)) = (s(0), i(0), r(0))$ are known.

In this set of ODEs, the instantaneous rate of change in the number of susceptibles is equal to parameter $\beta$ times the number of susceptibles and the number of infectious.  Another way to think of this is that the susceptibles and infectious interact homogeneously with one another and become infected at rate $\beta$.  The instantaneous rate of change of the number of recovered is equal to parameter $\gamma$ times the number of infectious, or that the infectious are recovering at rate $\gamma$.  Then finally, $I^\prime(t) = -S^\prime(t) - R^\prime(t)$, since the sum of the derivatives is zero.

In `R`, this requires special software to solve these ODEs, which have no known closed form solution.  We adapt the following code from an example shown in the epirecipes project [@epirecipes] and convert it to a `tidy` format.

```{r}
library(deSolve)
sirmod = function(t, y, parms) {
    # Pull state variables from y vector
    S = y[1]
    I = y[2]
    R = y[3]
    # Pull parameter values from parms vector
    beta = parms["beta"]
    gamma = parms["gamma"]
    N = S + I + R
    # Define equations
    dS = - beta * S * I/N
    dI = beta * S * I/N -  gamma * I
    dR = gamma * I
    res = c(dS, dI, dR)
    # Return list of gradients
    list(res)
}

times <- seq(0, 100, by = .01)
parms <- c("beta" = .1, "gamma" = .03)
inits <- c(S = 950, I = 50, R = 0 )

sir <- ode(y = inits, times = times, func = sirmod,
           parms = parms)

tidy_df <- sir %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")

```

We can then plot the number in each state.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tidy_df, aes(x = time, y = value, group = state,
                       col = state)) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('S' = "blue", 'I' = "red", 'R' ="darkgreen"))
```

### A deterministic, discrete time SIR model

This version takes the continuous time version of [@kermack1927] and discretizes the time steps.  We will assume the time step $\Delta t=1$, and the  *difference* equations for $t= 1, \dots, T$ are

$$
\left [S(t) - S(t-1)\right ] = -\beta S(t-1)I(t-1)\\
\left [I(t) - I(t-1)\right ] = \beta S(t-1)I(t-1) - \gamma I(t-1)\\
\left [S(t) - S(t-1)\right ] = \gamma I(t-1),
$$
which are the first order approximations of the ODEs.

We can program this model with a simple for loop.

```{r}
## discrete time and deterministic
sir_dd <- function(parms = c('beta' = .1, 'gamma' = .03 ),
                          inits = c(950, 50, 0), T = 100){
  
  times <- 1:(T+1)
  mat <- matrix(0, ncol = 3, nrow = T + 1)
  colnames(mat) <- c("S", "I", "R")
  N <- sum(inits)
  mat[1,] <- inits
  for(tt in times[-1]){
    mat[tt, 1] <- mat[tt-1, 1] - parms["beta"] * mat[tt-1, 1] * mat[tt-1, 2] / N
    mat[tt, 3] <- mat[tt-1, 3] + parms["gamma"] * mat[tt-1, 2]
    mat[tt, 2] <- N - mat[tt, 1] - mat[tt, 3]
    
  }
  df <- data.frame(time = times, mat)
  return(df)
      }

out_dd <- sir_dd(parms = c('beta' = .1, 'gamma' = .03 ),
                          inits = c(950, 50, 0), T = 100)

tidy_dd <- out_dd %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tidy_dd, aes(x = time, y = value, group = state,
                       col = state)) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('S' = "blue", 'I' = "red", 'R' ="darkgreen"))
```

We overlay the deterministic continuous time and the deterministic discrete time so see how good the discrete time is of the continuous.

```{r}
tidy_df$type <- "dc"
tidy_dd$type <- "dd"

new_df <- bind_rows(tidy_df, tidy_dd) %>%
  mutate(group = paste(state,type, sep = "-"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = new_df, aes(x = time, y = value, group = group,
                       col = state,
                       linetype = type)) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('S' = "blue", 'I' = "red", 'R' ="darkgreen"))

```

As we can see, these are good approximations of one another but not exact.  In fact, when we fix $\Delta t = 1$, the two sets of curves can be made arbitrarily close to one another, provided we scale $\beta$ and $\gamma$ correctly.

Here are some simulations when $\beta = .01$ and $\gamma = .003$ (with $T=1000$).

```{r echo = FALSE}

beta <- .01
gamma <- .003

## cts time
times <- seq(0, 1000, by = .01)
parms <- c("beta" = beta, "gamma" = gamma)
inits <- c(S = 950, I = 50, R = 0 )


sir <- ode(y = inits, times = times, func = sirmod,
           parms = parms)

tidy_df <- sir %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")

## scirete time
out_dd <- sir_dd(parms = c('beta' = beta, 'gamma' = gamma),
                          inits = c(950, 50, 0), T = 1000)
tidy_dd <- out_dd %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")


## overlay
tidy_df$type <- "dc"
tidy_dd$type <- "dd"

new_df <- bind_rows(tidy_df, tidy_dd) %>%
  mutate(group = paste(state,type, sep = "-"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = new_df, aes(x = time, y = value, group = group,
                       col = state,
                       linetype = type)) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('S' = "blue", 'I' = "red", 'R' ="darkgreen"))

```

And when $\beta = .2$ and $\gamma = .06$ (with $T=50$).
```{r echo = FALSE}

beta <- .2
gamma <- .06

## cts time
times <- seq(0, 50, by = .01)
parms <- c("beta" = beta, "gamma" = gamma)
inits <- c(S = 950, I = 50, R = 0 )


sir <- ode(y = inits, times = times, func = sirmod,
           parms = parms)

tidy_df <- sir %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")

## scirete time
out_dd <- sir_dd(parms = c('beta' = beta, 'gamma' = gamma),
                          inits = c(950, 50, 0), T = 50)
tidy_dd <- out_dd %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "state")


## overlay
tidy_df$type <- "dc"
tidy_dd$type <- "dd"

new_df <- bind_rows(tidy_df, tidy_dd) %>%
  mutate(group = paste(state,type, sep = "-"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = new_df, aes(x = time, y = value, group = group,
                       col = state,
                       linetype = type)) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('S' = "blue", 'I' = "red", 'R' ="darkgreen"))

```

## Next step

In the [next vignette](hagelloch-sir-fit.html), we will take the continuous time, deterministic SIR model and fit it to the Hagelloch SIR data.
